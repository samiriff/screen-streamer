# Screen Streamer

Capture a portion of your screen at periodic intervals and stream each frame as Numpy arrays (via Websockets) which can be consumed by remote environments. One sample use case would be to stream frames of a video playing on your laptop screen to a remote environment such as  Google Colaboratory, where you can train a neural network using Tensorflow with a GPU.
